# BookGenie

Welcome to the BookGenie app! This is an easy to use CRUD, MVC app created using Sinatra and ActiveRecord to offer a magical place where your friend BookGenie stores all the books you've been dying to read all your life. Yes, those dusty books stacked on your bookshelf, the ones hidden by your bedside table and used as coffee table decorations around your house that you have not gotten around to finishing since high school. As our world faces a global pandemic, take this time to relax and sit down with a book! BookGenie also offers a free Reading Book Cafe that has a bomb zen playlist that will take your imagination to the next level and enjoy some peaceful tunes while you read! 

Take BookGenie wherever you are on the go via our mobile app, share your BookGenie list with friends and set custom reading and time schedules that help you map out the timeframe of when you want to finish your books!

Simply sign up for free, create and store your personal booklist and set your reading schedule! 


# Motivation

With how fast paced social media, the news outlets, techonology and more is evolving, it can be hard to not be distracted and make time to finally check off those books that have been on your booklist for ages. Let us help you take away the stress of planning when to start and end your books and help you find suitable times in your daily schedule to fit 5 minutes of reading. Everyone has 5 minutes to spare! Many studies have shown how reading can decrease stress levels, help you have more empathy, leave you feeling inspired and spark creativity or understanding in other projects you are working on! Use BookGenie during this COVID-19 crisis to unleash your inner bookworm and read (as Lionel Richie would say) all night long! All night long!!!
